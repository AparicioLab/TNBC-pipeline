TNBC-Primer Design Pipeline
===========================

Pipeline V2.0 for TNBC 

1. SNP mask
2. Tried to do repeat masking of genome at levels of design but too computational intensive - too many fail primer3
2. Filter out primers at primer3 desing phase with MISPRIMING library
3. Get Ranges to accept ranges
4. Annotation of SNVs (cannot be SNP masked!)
